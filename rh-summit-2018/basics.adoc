== Environment

The lab environment provides a virtualized setup for developing and running Kafka applications on OpenShift.
It consists of:

* an OpenShift cluster with one master node and three worker nodes;
* a workstation;

During the lab you will interact with the OpenShift cluster via CLI from the workstation and from the browser available on your station.
Make note of the URLs that you will use during the lab.

|===
| Machine | URL | Access
| Workstation | `workstation-<GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com` | SSH (port 22)
| Master (OpenShift console) | `openshift-<GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com` | HTTPS (port 8443)
|===

[NOTE]
.Remember your GUID
At the start of the lab you have been provided with a GUID , which uniquely identifies your lab environment.
In the following instructions, replace the `<GUID>` placeholder with your GUID.
For example, if your GUID is `a2b3`, the URL `workstation-<GUID>.example.com` becomes `workstation-a2b3.example.com`.

Now, let's start the lab.
