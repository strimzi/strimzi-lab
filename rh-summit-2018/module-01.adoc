== Deploying an Apache Kafka cluster with Strimzi

Let's get started by deploying an Apache Kafka cluster on OpenShift.
For this, we will use http://strimzi.io/[Strimzi], an open-source project that simplifies the process of deploying and managing Apache Kafka clusters on Kubernetes and OpenShift.

=== How Strimzi works

You can run an Apache Kafka cluster on Kubernetes, and by extension, on OpenShift, in a variety of ways, not all being equal in terms of ease of use and maintenance.

For example, you can deploy the cluster manually as a stateful set.
While this can get you past the initial hurdle of starting the cluster, soon you have to start performing more complex tasks such as changing cluster topology, modifying configuration, or administering topics.
These tasks typically require direct access to the cluster nodes and can easily become cumbersome.

Strimzi simplifies these tasks by using a declarative approach to cluster and topic management, based on the controller pattern.
Instead of relying on direct deployment and management of clusters, Strimzi consists of a couple of controllers that monitor the state of the cluster, making adjustments in accordance to a desired state read from dedicated ConfigMaps.

For creating an Apache Kafka cluster, for instance, you need to create a ConfigMap that describes the properties of the cluster, and the *_cluster controller_* will deploy the cluster for you.
If you need to change the state of the cluster, for example for changing properties or for adding new instances, all you have to do is to modify the ConfigMap and the changes will be rolled out accordingly.

Topic management works in a similar fashion: for creating and modifying topics, you only need to create and edit a set of ConfigMaps and the *_topic controller_* will do the work for you.

You will do all this as part of the first lab.

=== Installing Strimzi

First, connect via SSH to the workstation.
The keys for connecting remotely to the workstation are already provisioned on your machine.

[source, sh]
$ ssh cloud-user@workstation-<GUID>.generic.opentlc.com

Strimzi is already downloaded on your machine and available in the `strimzi` directory.

[source, sh]
$ cd strimzi

Log in as administrator to install Strimzi:
# We will need to provide a better password for this, but I will not put it in GitHub for now

[source,sh]
$ oc login -u admin https://master.example.com:8443

Note that the workstation is on the same virtual network as the OpenShift cluster.
The URL `master.example.com` is only available to use from the workstation.

Next, create a new project for the lab:

[source, sh]
$ oc new-project l1099-kafka

You can see that it is empty:

[source, sh]
$ oc get pods
No resources found.

Install the cluster controller:

[source, sh]
$ oc create -f examples/install/cluster-controller

You should see a few resources being created:

[source, sh]
serviceaccount "strimzi-cluster-controller" created
role "strimzi-cluster-controller-role" created
rolebinding "strimzi-cluster-controller-binding" created
deployment "strimzi-cluster-controller" created

The service account `strimzi-cluster-controller` is granted permission to access various resources in the project.
This allows it to read the config maps containing the cluster configuration that we will create later in the process.

Now, make sure that the cluster controller is deployed.

[source,sh]
$ oc get pods

The command output should be similar to:

[source,sh]
NAME                                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
strimzi-cluster-controller-2044197322-lzrvr   1/1       Running   0          3m

Next, install the Strimzi templates.
The templates contain predefined config maps for easily deploying clusters (for Kafka Connect as well).

[source, sh]
$ oc create -f examples/templates/cluster-controller
template "strimzi-connect-s2i" created
template "strimzi-connect" created
template "strimzi-ephemeral" created
template "strimzi-persistent" created

Now you can deploy a Kafka cluster by creating a config map.
For this lab, we will use a template, but you can create and deploy a regular config map as well.

[source,sh]
$ oc new-app strimzi-ephemeral

The expected output should be similar to:
[source,sh]

The key resource is the `my-cluster` config map.

Let's see what it contains.

[source,sh]

$ oc get cm my-cluster -o yaml

    {

            "name": "kafka_server_$1_$2_total"
          },
          {

            "name": "kafka_server_$1_$2_total",
            "labels":
            {

---------

The properties of the map control the cluster configuration.
Notice the `kafka-nodes` and `zookeeper-nodes` properties, with values of 3 and 1, respectively.
This deployment has one Zookeeper node and three Kafka brokers.

Visualize the running pods:

[source,sh]
$ oc get pods

You might need to run the command a few times, with different results, as the pods are spinning up, but you should see the results stabilizing as:

[source,sh]
$ oc get pods
NAME                                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-cluster-kafka-0                             1/1       Running   0          2m
my-cluster-kafka-1                             1/1       Running   0          2m
my-cluster-kafka-2                             1/1       Running   0          2m
my-cluster-topic-controller-1422164134-f9n8r   1/1       Running   0          1m
my-cluster-zookeeper-0                         1/1       Running   0          3m
strimzi-cluster-controller-2044197322-lzrvr    1/1       Running   0          11m

In addition to the `cluster controler` created previously, notice a few more deployments:

* the `topic controller` is now deployed as well - you can deploy it independently, but the Strimzi template deploys it out of the box;
* one Zookeeper node
* three Kafka brokers

Also, notice that the Zookeeper ensemble and the Kafka cluster are deployed as stateful sets.

Now your Kafka cluster is running and ready to go.
Let's build some applications!
