== Running an IoT application with Kafka Streams

The IoT demo is made by different components with the following architecture :

image::iot-demo.png[iot-demo]

* one or more device simulators which sends temperature values to the `iot-temperature` topic;
* a stream application which uses Kafka Streams API in order to get data from the `iot-temperature` topic and process them to compute the maximum value (for each device) in the last 5 seconds; it writes the results to the `iot-temperature-max` topic;
* a consumer application which reads messages from the `iot-temperature-max` topic and provides a Web UI for showing them;

=== Create topics

This demo uses a couple of topics.
The first one named `iot-temperature` is used by the device simulator for sending temperature values and by the stream application for getting such values and processing them.
The second one is the `iot-temperature-max` topic where the stream application puts the max temperature value processed in the specified time window.
In order to create these topics in the Kafka cluster, the Topic Controller can be used.
Running the following command, a file containing two topic ConfigMaps is deployed to the OpenShift cluster and used by the Topic Controller for creating such topics.

[source,sh]
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-lab/master/iot-demo/stream-app/resources/topics.yml

In order to check that the topics are properly created on the Kafka cluster, it's possible to use the `kafka-topics.sh` script (distributed with Kafka) running it on one of the broker.

[source,sh]
$ oc exec -it my-cluster-kafka-0 -- bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper my-cluster-zookeeper:2181 --list

The output of the above command should be something like the following showing the created topics.

[source,sh]
iot-temperature
iot-temperature-max

=== Deploy the consumer application

The consumer application uses Kafka client in order to get messages from the `iot-temperature-max` topic and showing them in a Web UI.
It's deployed by running following command :

[source,sh]
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-lab/master/iot-demo/consumer-app/resources/consumer-app.yml

A route is provided in order to access the related Web UI.

=== Deploy the stream application

The stream application uses Kafka Streams API reading from the `iot-temperature` topic, processing its values and then putting the max temperature value in the specified time window into the `iot-temperature-max` topic.
It's deployed running following command :

[source,sh]
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-lab/master/iot-demo/stream-app/resources/stream-app.yml

=== Deploy the device application

The device application provides a device simulator which sends temperature values to the `iot-temperature` topic.

[source,sh]
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-lab/master/iot-demo/device-app/resources/device-app.yml

Once deployed, it starts just one pod simulating one device.

it's possible to scale up the number of pods in order to simulate more devices sending temperature values (each one with a different and randomly generated id).

Opening the consumer Web UI it's possible to see the "gauges" charts showing the processed max temperature values for all the active devices on the left side.
The right side is useful to see the log of the incoming messages from devices, showing the device id alongside the max temperature value processed by the stream application for such a device.

=== Clean up

Before moving to the next module, it's useful to clean up the current deployment deleting all the related resources in terms of Pods, Services, Routes and Deployments.

[source,sh]
$ oc delete all -l app=iot-demo
route "consumer-app" deleted
pod "consumer-app-3541966467-wpq25" deleted
pod "device-app-3765817752-sd7lk" deleted
pod "stream-app-3267945040-8hztf" deleted
service "consumer-app" deleted
deployment "consumer-app" deleted
deployment "device-app" deleted
deployment "stream-app" deleted

And finally the topic config maps

[source,sh]
$ oc delete cm -l strimzi.io/kind=topic
configmap "iot-temperature" deleted
configmap "iot-temperature-max" deleted
configmap "streams-temperature-kstream-reduce-state-store-0000000001-changelog---419dc8153c3f17b91352f18537da3886a84f3935" deleted
