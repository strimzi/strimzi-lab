# Tutorial: Deploying Apache Kafka on Kubernetes

## Prerequisites

During the tutorial, Apache Kafka will be deployed in cloud based Kubernetes environments.
To do the tutorial and use Apache Kafka from your laptop, you will need the following tools:
* Java Runtime Environment 8 or 11 ([download](https://adoptopenjdk.net/))
* `kubectl` [installation instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* `git` [installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* Downloaded binaries of Apache Kafka 2.4 clients [download](http://kafka.apache.org/downloads)

We recommend downloading or installing these tools before the conference to avoid problems caused by WiFi issues.

**The prerequisites might be updated one week before the conference. 
Please check this page for changes.**
